Project: LibrarySystem

This project implements linear and binary search algorithms to find books by title.

Time Complexity:
- Linear Search: O(n)
- Binary Search: O(log n) â€” requires sorted data

Use linear search for small or unsorted datasets.
Use binary search for large and sorted datasets.

By running BookSearchTest.java we can compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.
