Project: OrderSorting

This project demonstrates sorting customer orders by total price using:
- Bubble Sort (O(n²)) — simple but slow for large data
- Quick Sort (O(n log n) average) — much faster for large datasets

Quick Sort is generally preferred for performance-critical systems like e-commerce platforms.

By running SortTest.java we can compare both algorithms.
