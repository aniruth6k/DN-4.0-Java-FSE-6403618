Project: EmployeeSystem

This project demonstrates an Employee Management System using a fixed-size array.

Time Complexity:
- Add: O(1) (append at end)
- Search: O(n) (linear search)
- Traverse: O(n)
- Delete: O(n) (requires shifting elements)

Arrays are simple and efficient for small, fixed-size data. For dynamic sizing and faster deletions, prefer collections like ArrayList or HashMap.

By running EmployeeTest.java we can analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, search, traverse, delete).
