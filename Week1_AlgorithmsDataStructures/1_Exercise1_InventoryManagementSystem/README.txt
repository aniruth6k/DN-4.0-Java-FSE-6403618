Project: InventorySystem

This project demonstrates a basic Inventory Management System using a HashMap to store and manage products efficiently.

Time Complexity:
- Add Product: O(1)
- Update Product: O(1)
- Delete Product: O(1)
- Retrieve All Products: O(n)

HashMap provides optimal performance for real-time inventory lookup and modification.

By running InventoryTest.java we can verify operations.
