Project: EcommerceSearch

This project demonstrates Linear and Binary Search for e-commerce product lookup.

Time Complexities:
- Linear Search: O(n) Worst, Best: O(1)
- Binary Search: O(log n) Worst, Best: O(1) â€” requires sorted data

Binary search is more suitable for platforms with sorted and large datasets for faster lookup.
By running SearchTest.java we can compare both search methods.
