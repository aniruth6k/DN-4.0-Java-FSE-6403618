Project: TaskManagerSystem

This project implements a Task Management System using a Singly Linked List.

Time Complexity:
- Add Task: O(n)
- Search Task: O(n)
- Traverse Tasks: O(n)
- Delete Task: O(n)

Advantages over arrays:
- Dynamic sizing (no need for predefined capacity)
- Efficient insert/delete (no shifting needed)

By running TaskTest.java we can test the functionality.
