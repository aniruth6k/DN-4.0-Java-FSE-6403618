This project demonstrates the difference between Hibernate and Spring Data JPA.

1. hibernate-approach:
   - Manual session and transaction handling with Hibernate.
   - Employee.java: Entity.
   - HibernateApp.java: Main with save logic.

2. springdatajpa-approach:
   - Uses Spring Data JPA to avoid boilerplate.
   - Employee.java: Entity.
   - SpringDataJpaApp.java: Main with repository usage.
