This project consists of two simple Spring Boot microservices: Account and Loan.

- Account microservice runs on port 8080 and returns dummy account details for a given account number.
- Loan microservice runs on port 8081 and returns dummy loan details for a given loan number.

These services are stateless and do not connect to any backend database.
They are useful for demonstrating microservice architecture and service separation.
